Responsibilities:
- As a part of a server-side team, development and supporting backend services of the high-loaded multi-instrumental trading platform and later the crypto-currency exchange (trading functionality: orders matching and processing, user management, various stateless and stateful services, interactions with Postrgesql and RabbitMQ);

Lately I've been doing a lot of infrastructural and DevOps-related tasks. Optimized project build processes, CI pipelines and DB migrations. Implemented Docker/Compose based environment for local development executing all backend services, which made it possible to write full-fledged end-to-end tests for the company's server products.

I wrote a lot of regression tests (proprietary junit based framework) for validating different trading workflows and interactions with internal services of the bank application stack, as well as with external services of markets, the part of tests was for checking failover of service (communication failures, switching to hot standby, etc.). My team and I created the quoting/ negotiation/booking-services for BondVision-market from scratch, as a result they were taken for UAT- testing; the functional of Bloomberg and Tradeweb services were extended to support trading of CDS (one-legged / multi-legged), there was completed UAT-testing and started operation.
